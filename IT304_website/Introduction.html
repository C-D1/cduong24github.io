                <p class="content-body">Facial recognition is a type of biometric technology that uses certain algorithms and artificial intelligence to identify or verify individuals based on their unique facial features. The technology analyzes specific details of a person’s face, such as the distance between their eyes, the shape of their nose, the way their lips look, and many more, to create a digital map of their face; which is commonly known as a “faceprint”. This faceprint is then compared to the images that have been stored in the database to make sure they match, before authenticating the user. Facial recognition can be used for unlocking your device, downloading applications, getting to saved passwords, paying for things, etc..</p>

                <h1 class="content-header">Why did we choose this topic?</h1>
                <p class="content-body">Our team chose facial recognition because it is one of the most transformative technologies of our time. From unlocking smartphones with just a quick glance to passing through security at airports in a breeze, facial recognition combines convenience with cutting-edge technology. It has definitely become an essential tool in our everyday lifestyle, as well as in industries like law enforcement, retail, and finance, where it enhances security, improves efficiency, and personalizes user experiences. Additionally, this technology addresses critical challenges, such as identifying missing people, or verifying somebody's identity in a specific situation. However, it also raises significant concerns about ethics, privacy, and potential misuse. These challenges make it a compelling topic, as the technology not only showcases innovation but also highlights the need for responsible development and regulation.Ultimately we look to propose future strategies that promote the responsible and ethical use of facial recognition, ensuring it benefits society while addressing its potential risks and challenges. </p>
