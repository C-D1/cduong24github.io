        <h2>Personal Information (PI)</h2>
        <p>The main type of data that revolves around most ethical issues is with personal information. When using the internet, signing up, or purchasing products, people are using their personal information to do these actions. When giving this personal information to businesses and companies, they can exploit this information to make money off this valuable information by either using or selling off this data to others without the users consent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Its common for companies to be comprised of many other third parties for specific technologies/services that they cant develop themselves. Because of this, when something goes wrong with the use of data, personal information, or security, it becomes confusing and difficult to determine who is the responible for the damages. At the end of the day, it is everyones responsibility to protect user data, even when relying on third parties.</p>
