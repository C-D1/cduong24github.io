                <h1 class="content-header">Example 1: Enchancing Airport Security</h1>
                <p class="content-body">Facial recognition technology is revolutionizing airport security and passenger processing, offering both convenience and enhanced safety. One notable implementation is at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where Delta Air Lines launched a comprehensive biometric system for international travelers. This system integrates facial recognition into various stages of the travel experience, including check-in, baggage drop, TSA screening, and boarding.
                    The process begins when a passenger opts in by linking their passport details to their facial data during check-in. Cameras at each touchpoint capture the passenger's image, which is then compared to photos stored in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) databases. If the match is successful, the traveler can proceed without needing physical paper documents such as passports or boarding passes.
                    This use of facial recognition has significantly reduced wait times and boosted the travel experience. Furthermore, this technology minimizes physical contact, an especially valuable feature during the COVID-19 pandemic when reducing touchpoints became a priority.
                    Despite its advantages, the implementation of facial recognition at airports has sparked concerns about privacy and data security. Critics question how biometric data is stored, who has access to it, and how long it is retained. Additionally, some passengers are unaware of the option to opt out or may not fully understand how their data will be used. Addressing these issues is critical to ensuring public trust and the responsible deployment of this technology in airport settings.

                <h1 class="content-header">Example 2 here</h1>
                <p class="content-body">Our team chose facial recognition because it is one of the most transformative technologies of our time. From unlocking smartphones with just a quick glance to passing through security at airports in a breeze, facial recognition combines convenience with cutting-edge technology. It has definitely become an essential tool in our everyday lifestyle, as well as in industries like law enforcement, retail, and finance, where it enhances security, improves efficiency, and personalizes user experiences. Additionally, this technology addresses critical challenges, such as identifying missing people, or verifying somebody's identity in a specific situation. However, it also raises significant concerns about ethics, privacy, and potential misuse. These challenges make it a compelling topic, as the technology not only showcases innovation but also highlights the need for responsible development and regulation.Ultimately we look to propose future strategies that promote the responsible and ethical use of facial recognition, ensuring it benefits society while addressing its potential risks and challenges. </p>
