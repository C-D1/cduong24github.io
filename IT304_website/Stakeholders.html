                <h1 class="content-header">Who are the main audience of this ethical analysis?</h1>
                <p class="content-body">The main audience for the ethics of facial recognition technology will be citizens, policymakers, and engineers. Citizens will be the majority of those who use and are subject to facial recognition technology, directly affecting their privacy and rights. Policymakers will have to deal with and decide on how to create regulations that structure how facial recognition will be used or restricted based on ethics. Engineers have direct ties in the creation of facial recognition technology, so they have the main responsibility to make sure facial recognition technology is safe, secure, and accurate when used.

            <div class="content-section">
                <h1 class="content-header">Why Should They Care, and What Should They Do?</h1>
                <p class="content-body">These main stakeholders should care because facial recognition technology touches on three critical issues: privacy, fairness, and accountability. Citizens should care because when using this technology, they put their private/personal data and face data at stake. Without strong regulations and controls over facial recognition technology, this technology can be used to exploit millions of citizen's personal face information data to access other sensitive information about them. Policymakers should care because their entire job is the create regulations to protect the public. If they do not make strong regulations for this technology, many companies will use this technology in a way that will worsen privacy protection, discriminatory practices, and more. Finally, Engineers should care because their jobs rely on their ability to create technology that follows strict ethical laws set for technology, and if not followed, they can lose their jobs and suffer large consequences due to their negligence.</p>

                <h1 class="content-header">Recommendations for Stakeholder</h1>
                <p class="content-body">Citizens are recommended to educate themselves more on facial recognition technology to understand its benefits and risks to see if they want to use, contribute, or avoid this technology.
                    Policymakers are recommended to create strong regulations that set a strong standard for the use of facial recognition technology. Aspects such as transparency, restrictions, and data protection should be enforced to ensure safe use of facial regulation tech.
                    Engineers are recommended to center their creation process around privacy, meaning that their technology should reduce the amount of data collected from users and use cybersecurity techniques to protect users. They also must continue to test and improve their technology to maintain fairness for different demographics when using their technology.</p>
